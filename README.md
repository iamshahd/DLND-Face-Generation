# DLND-Face-Generation
Project 4 for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

I used two datasets in this project:
- MNIST
- CelebA

Since the celebA dataset is complex and I am doing GANs in a project for the first time, Udacity recommended I test the neural network on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST allowed me to see how well my model trains sooner.
